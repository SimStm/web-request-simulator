# Web Request Simulator

This is a basic, lightweight web server using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as JavaScript/TypeScript runtime.

This app is really useful in some situations, like:
- When you need to retrieve some token, text or a HTML page fast, without the need to configure a `Nginx/Apache` web server, or even creating an `Express` application from zero
- When you are trying to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for a domain/subdomain you own, but you can't solve the `.well-known/acme-challenge/xxxxxxxx` challenge
- Retrieve any kind of mock response for any URL path

You can point your IP/host to this app, and he'll retrieve what you pass through environment variables. Simple as that.
